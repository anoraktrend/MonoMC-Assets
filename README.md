# MonoMC-Assets
Branding assets for forks of MultiMC distributed by unsupported distros. Similar to IceWeasel, these assets are modifiable but do not require modification to be redistributable. Do note, however, distributions of MonoMC are not standardized, not monitored, and not curated by myself nor anyone involved with MultiMC. If there are bugs, tell your distro's maintainer first. If it turns out to be from upstream or caused by a lack of documentation from Multimc, that's when you should contact multimc.
